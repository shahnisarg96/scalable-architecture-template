## Overview

The **Scalable Services Bundle** is a modular and scalable microservices architecture designed for managing various aspects of a university system. Each service is independently deployable and communicates with others through REST APIs. The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, providing routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and logging functionalities.

---

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services for authentication, students, faculty, courses, and enrollment.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and logging.
- **Kafka Integration**: Event-driven communication for logging and audit purposes.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL as the primary database for all services.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects services from abuse.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Centralized logging using Kafka and audit logs.

---

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **API Gateway**:
   - Handles routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and logging.
   - Sends logs to Kafka for centralized logging.

2. **Authentication Service**:
   - Manages user signup, login, and JWT token generation.

3. **Student Service**:
   - Handles CRUD operations for student data.

4. **Faculty Service**:
   - Manages faculty data and their course assignments.

5. **Course Service**:
   - Handles CRUD operations for course data.

6. **Enrollment Service**:
   - Manages student enrollments in courses.

7. **Audit Service**:
   - Consumes logs from Kafka and writes them to a persistent log file.

8. **Kafka**:
   - Acts as the message broker for event-driven communication and logging.

9. **PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Each microservice has its own database schema for isolation.

---

### 6. **Audit Service**
- **Functionality**:
  - Consumes logs from the Kafka topic (`app-logs`).
  - Writes logs to a persistent log file located at `/app/logs/audit.log`.

---

## Kafka Integration

### Producer: API Gateway
- The API Gateway sends logs to a Kafka topic (`app-logs`) using a Kafka producer.
- Logs include request and response details for all API calls.

### Consumer: Audit Service
- The Audit Service consumes logs from the Kafka topic (`app-logs`) and writes them to a persistent log file.
- Logs are stored in a directory mounted on a persistent volume.

## Setup and Installation

## Running the Microservices Bundle Locally with Minikube

This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up Minikube and `kubectl` on your local machine and deploy the microservices bundle using the `deploy.sh` script.

---

### Prerequisites

1. **Minikube**:
   - Install Minikube by following the official guide: [Minikube Installation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     minikube version
     ```

2. **kubectl**:
   - Install `kubectl` by following the official guide: [kubectl Installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     kubectl version --client
     ```

3. **Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

---

### Steps to Deploy the Microservices Bundle

1. **Start Minikube**:
   - Start Minikube if it is not already running:
     ```bash
     minikube start
     ```

2. **Switch Docker to Minikube's Daemon**:
   - Configure Docker to use Minikube's Docker daemon:
     ```bash
     eval $(minikube docker-env)
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shahnisarg96/scalable-architecture-template.git
     cd scalable-services-bundle
     ```

4. **Make the Deploy Script Executable**:
   - Ensure the `deploy.sh` script is executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x deploy.sh
     ```

5. **Run the Deploy Script**:
   - Execute the `deploy.sh` script to build and deploy the microservices:
     ```bash
     ./deploy.sh
     ```

6. **Access the API Gateway**:
   - Once the script completes, the API Gateway will be accessible at:
     ```
     http://localhost:30080
     ```

---

### What the `deploy.sh` Script Does

1. **Starts Minikube** (if not already running).
2. **Switches Docker to Minikube's Daemon** to build images directly in Minikube's environment.
3. **Generates RSA Keys for JWT**:
   - The script generates a private-public key pair (`private.pem` and `public.pem`) for JWT signing and verification using the RS256 algorithm.
   - These keys are stored in a `keys` directory.
4. **Creates Kubernetes Secrets for JWT Keys**:
   - The generated keys are securely stored as Kubernetes secrets (`jwt-keys`) and mounted into the `ss-auth-service` and `ss-api-gateway` pods.
5. **Builds Docker Images**:
   - Builds Docker images for all microservices without using the cache.
6. **Deploys PostgreSQL**:
   - Deploys the PostgreSQL database and waits for it to be ready.
7. **Initializes the Database Schema**:
   - Runs a Kubernetes Job to initialize the database schema.
8. **Deploys Core Microservices**:
   - Authentication Service
   - Student Service
   - Faculty Service
   - Course Service
   - Enrollment Service
9. **Deploys the API Gateway**:
   - Deploys the API Gateway and waits for it to be ready.
10. **Sets Up Port Forwarding**:
    - Forwards the API Gateway service to `localhost:30080`.

### Verifying the Deployment

1. **Check Services**:
   - Ensure all services are running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get services
     ```

2. **Check Pods**:
   - Ensure all pods are running and ready:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```

3. **Test the API Gateway**:
   - Use `curl` or Postman to test the `/health` endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:30080/health
     ```

4. **Verify JWT Keys**:
   - Ensure the `jwt-keys` secret is created:
     ```bash
     kubectl get secrets
     ```
   - Check that the keys are mounted in the `ss-auth-service` pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ls /app/keys
     ```

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check Logs**:
   - If a service fails, check its logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <pod-name>
     ```

2. **Restart Minikube**:
   - If Minikube encounters issues, restart it:
     ```bash
     minikube stop
     minikube start
     ```

3. **Re-run the Deploy Script**:
   - If deployment fails, re-run the script:
     ```bash
     [deploy.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)
     ```

## Verifying Kafka Integration

1. **Check Kafka Logs**:
   - Verify that the API Gateway is producing logs to the Kafka topic:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <api-gateway-pod-name>
     ```

2. **Check Audit Logs**:
   - Verify that the Audit Service is consuming logs and writing them to the file:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <audit-service-pod-name> -- cat /app/logs/audit.log
     ```

## API Documentation

### Swagger Documentation
The Swagger documentation for the microservices is available at the following endpoint once the services are running:
```
http://localhost:30080/swagger-ui
```
This provides an interactive API documentation interface for testing and exploring the available endpoints.

### Postman Collection
A Postman collection is included in the project repository for testing the API endpoints. You can find the collection file in the parent directory of the project:
```
./postman_collection.json
```
To use the collection:
1. Open Postman.
2. Import the collection file by navigating to `File > Import` and selecting the `.json` file.
3. Use the pre-configured requests to test the API endpoints.
